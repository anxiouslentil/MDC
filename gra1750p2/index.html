			<h2> 2nd Brain Amuse-Bouche</h2>
			<p>This recipe emerged from improvisation—a conversation with my gut, letting my second brain guide my hands. Each layer was placed by intuition, listening to the cravings of my microbiome rather than following steps. You can recreate this exact sculpture, or gather these materials and let your own enteric wisdom take over, building something entirely yours. Either way, you&rsquo;re feeding the microbes within and the creative impulse that lives in your gut.</p>
